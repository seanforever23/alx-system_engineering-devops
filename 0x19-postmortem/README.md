Postmortem: Replit Outage - 05 May 2024
Issue Summary
Duration: 1 hour and 30 minutes, starting at 14:00 SAST (South Africa Time ) and ending at 15:30 SAST.

Impact: Replit experienced a partial outage affecting approximately 70% of users. Users reported slow loading times, intermittent connection errors, and inability to save or execute code. The "Run" button functionality was particularly impacted.

Root Cause: A surge in traffic to our database servers due to a popular coding challenge being shared on social media led to resource exhaustion and eventually a database crash. This resulted in cascading failures throughout the Replit's backend services.

Timeline
14:00 SAST: A system administrator noticed a sharp increase in database server CPU usage through our monitoring dashboards.
14:15 SAST: Users started reporting slow loading times and connection issues.
14:30 SAST: The database server crashed, leading to a complete failure of the Replit's backend services.
14:45 SAST: The incident was escalated to the engineering team, who began investigating the root cause.
15:00 SAST: Initial investigations focused on potential network issues, leading to a brief period of misdiagnosis.
15:15 SAST: After analyzing logs and monitoring data, the engineering team identified the surge in database traffic as the likely cause.
15:30 SAST: A quick fix was implemented by scaling up the database server resources. This restored functionality for all users.
Root Cause and Resolution
The sudden surge in traffic, primarily related to the popular coding challenge, overwhelmed the database servers. The existing server capacity was insufficient to handle the increased load. This led to the database crashing and subsequently affected all backend services, causing the IDE outage.

The issue was resolved by immediately scaling up the database server resources. This allowed the database to handle the increased traffic and recover from the crash.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent similar incidents in the future, we need to implement the following:

Improvements:

Dynamic Scaling: Implement dynamic scaling of database resources to automatically adjust to fluctuating traffic patterns.
Traffic Throttling: Introduce mechanisms to throttle traffic to the database during spikes, preventing overloading.
Real-time Monitoring: Enhance real-time monitoring of database server metrics to identify potential issues before they escalate.
Tasks:

Implement dynamic scaling: Integrate a dynamic scaling solution for the database servers to automatically adjust resources based on traffic load.
Develop traffic throttling mechanism: Create a system to throttle traffic to the database during peak periods, preventing overload.
Add specific database metrics to monitoring: Expand monitoring dashboards to include key database metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, and query latency to provide early warning signals.
These improvements will ensure that Replit's IDE remains robust and resilient against future traffic surges and other potential issues.
